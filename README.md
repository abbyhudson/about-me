## Please let me know if you are a recruiter trying to look at my academic projects!

As per NC State's academic integrity policy, I am not allowed to publicly display any projects I create within classes. I can, however, share any repositories with a recruiter
for a limited amount of time, so please email me at abbyh0501@gmail.com if you would like to see them.

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Abby Hudson, I use she/her pronouns, and I am currently a rising junior at NC State majoring in Computer Science under the College of Engineering. I am in search of
either a co-op for spring or summer 2022, or an internship for summer 2022. I am proficient in Java and C and I am currently working on my C++ and Swift skills. I am currently 
a teaching assistant under the Department of Computer Science for a class that is essentially Java II. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions! I have also listed
my resume under this repository.

## Skills

I am proficient in Java and tools associated with it, including JUnit testing, the Eclipse IDE, Jenkins, the software development cycle, and much more. 

## Work Experience

I am currently a Peer Teaching Fellow (PTF) CSC 216 - Software Development Fundamentals, where I am an undergraduate teaching assistant who helps around 200 students at any 
given time in both coding and theoretical parts of what is taught in the class. I have been doing this for around over half a year now.
