## Please let me know if you are a recruiter trying to look at my academic projects!

As per NC State's academic integrity policy, I am not allowed to publicly display any projects I create within classes. I can, however, share any repositories with a recruiter
for a limited amount of time, so please email me at abbyh0501@gmail.com if you would like to see them.

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Abby Hudson, I use she/her pronouns, and I am currently a rising junior at NC State majoring in Computer Science under the College of Engineering. I am in search of
either a co-op for spring or summer 2022, or an internship for summer 2022. I am proficient in Java and C and I am currently working on my C++ and Swift skills. I am currently 
a teaching assistant under the Department of Computer Science for a class that is essentially Java II. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions! I have also listed
both my internship and co-op resume under this repository.

## Skills

Java was my first programming language, which I have been using for over 2 years now and consider myself proficient in. I have the LinkedIn Assessment Skill badge in Java. Within classes, we focused on Object-Oriented Programming concepts, such as polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance. There was an overall focus on the software development life cycle, where we read the requirements needed and analyzed it, spent time creating UML diagrams and design documents, implemented the code based off of it, used multiple testing techniques such as white box testing, unit testing via JUnit, black box testing, and continuous integration testing, and then maintaining the code after deployment. We have also focused on a variety of data structures like different lists, maps, and sort functions as well as their runtimes via algorithm analysis.

I have also been learning C language, which I have used for a little over half a year. I also have the LinkedIn Assessment Skill badge in C. It was quite a big jump to go from an object-oriented language to a procedural one. It was interesting to see how programming at a lower level worked compared to a higher level. We learned how to create custom structs and unions as well as being taught how joint compilation works via Makefiles and header files. Learning both Java and C also required me to learn Git, which I also have
a LinkedIn Assessment Skill badge for.

In my C class, we briefly touched on C++ at the very end. We learned about classes, constructors, destructors, friends, and differences between C and C++. While we didn't get to cover much, I am hoping to learn more in my free time. I am also currently learning about Swift in the hopes of developing my own app, as well as JavaScript, HTML and CSS to develop web applications.

## Work Experience

I am currently a Google-sponsored Peer Teaching Fellow (PTF) for the class CSC 216 - Software Development Fundamentals, where I am an undergraduate teaching assistant who helps around 200 students at any given time in both coding and theoretical parts of what is taught in the class. I have been doing this for around over half a year now. I answer any questions students might have on the online class forum known as Piazza, as well as holding office hours, where students can meet with me to ask any questions via Zoom. I also teach a lab section of the class with another PTF, CSC 217 - Software Development Fundamentals Lab, where we allow students to apply what they have learned in class via implementing code. They get to work with and create custom ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues, all while learning the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. I think this job
has really taught me how to communicate better as well as better my problem solving skills to help other students figure out what could be wrong with their code. It has also
helped me understand Java more deeply and help me become more proficient.

During the Fall 2020 semester, I also worked as a community assistant (CA). My job was to sit at the front desk of my residential hall and keep track of all the equipment and
keys to the entire building, as well as entering in packages to StarRez (NC State's housing portal) and check students in and out of their rooms and answer any questions they may have. I unfortunately could not finish working the whole semester due to the CoVID-19 pandemic. Despite my short time working at this job, I believe it helped me improve my interpersonal skills a lot and helped me communicate with my peers.
